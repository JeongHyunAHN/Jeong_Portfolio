### context : 

I found many job/intern offers requiring knowledge of tensorflow, image processing, and deep learning.  
I thought of taking this course on Udemy since it contained all the right keywords. 
- (url:https://www.udemy.com/course/master-deep-learning-for-computer-vision-with-tensorflow-2/#instructor-1)  

But, found this youtube video of 4h length which is free.
So, i'm going to try this first.

### method : 

I'm going to record here the things i've done in order to keep track of my accomplishments.  
I can later write on my cv or say during an interview, that i've followed this tutorial  
in order to learn about DL, tensorflow2, and image processing.  

Since the video is 4 hours long... I'll certainly need a way to keep track of my **progression**.
